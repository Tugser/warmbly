// Store is the abstraction over blob storage. One implementation suffices for

// self-hosters who don't want any object-storage service at all.
//
// Keys are opaque; implementations may translate to filesystem paths, S3
// object keys, etc. Callers should not assume a particular separator.

// returns for a key, so a caller can tell its own public objects from any

	// PutPublic writes an object meant to be served publicly (avatars, org

	// This exists because erasing a mailbox has to erase the message bodies it
	// synced, and there can be thousands of them under one prefix. Deleting
	// them one key at a time would mean a list the caller does not have.
	//

	// PresignedURL is PresignedGetURL generalised to the other verbs, so a
